Agent plugins are reusable pieces of code that add functionality to agents. Agents can use one or more multiple plugins.

Plugins are written in any of [eight languages](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk/) and compiled to WASM via the [Extism](https://extism.org/) framework.

## Bitcoin bounties available

For a limited time (until May 27th) we are paying bitcoin bounties of â‚¿1M each (~$600 USD as of 5/13) to plugin developers for their first agent plugin.

You can see the plugins previously awarded bounties [here](https://openagents.com/plugins).

To claim a bounty, follow these steps:

1. Write an Extism plugin using one of their eight [plugin development kits](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk/). It
   must expose one function called 'run' that takes a single string parameter and returns a single string. (Use JSON
   stringification as needed for larger objects.)
2. Upload the code to a GitHub repo.
3. Make a post in our Stacker News community like [this](https://stacker.news/items/537555) or [this](https://stacker.news/items/537303). Include the plugin name and description, GitHub repo, your [Lightning address](https://lightningaddress.com/) that should be used for rev-share rewards, and any other relevant info.
4. [DM us on X](https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc) a link to the SN post.

Rules:
- GitHub account must be older than 1 month

## Using plugins with agents

We will soon offer a UI and API for using plugins with agents.
