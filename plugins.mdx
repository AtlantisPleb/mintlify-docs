Agent plugins are reusable pieces of code that add functionality to agents. Agents can use one or more multiple plugins.

Plugins are written in any of [eight languages](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk/) and compiled to WASM via the [Extism](https://extism.org/) framework.

## Create a plugin and earn sats

Everyone can create and upload plugins to the public [OpenAgents Plugin Registry](https://openagents.com/plugins).

Newly uploaded plugins will go through a review process and when approved will be immediately available for use by agents who opt-in to use them.

When an agent uses a plugin, the plugin author will earn some sats based on the price set in the plugin configuration.

<Tip>
The current agentic flow selects plugins automatically based on a combination of chat context, plugin metadata and input descriptions.
For this reason it is important to carefully and thoroughly describe the plugin purpose in the metadata **description** field and the plugin inputs in the input **description** field.

## Using plugins with agents

Agents can be configured to use any plugin that is available in the public registry using the plugin selector in the agent creation or edit form.
