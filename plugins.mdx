## Getting paid for agent upgrades

Payouts are Bitcoin only, paid via the Lightning network.

For now this process is semi-manual.

1. Write an Extism plugin using one of their eight [plugin development kits](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk/). It
   must
   expose one function called 'run' that takes a single string parameter and returns a single string. (Use JSON
   stringification as needed for larger objects.)
2. Upload the code to a GitHub repo.
3. Send us a [DM us on X](https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc) (@OpenAgentsInc) with 1) a public-facing name and
   description for the plugin, 2) the link to the GitHub repo and 3) your
   [Lightning address](https://lightningaddress.com/)

The first 100 developers to submit a plugin we add to OpenAgents will receive â‚¿1M each (~$600 USD as of 4/17).

You can see previously submitted plugins [here](https://openagents.com/plugins).
