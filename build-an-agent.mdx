![f1 (2)](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/assets/93095163/390342ec-c7cb-4483-a671-995eb6daac7a)

1) You can build your Agent using the Agent Builder page (in the figure).

2) During preparation, give your Agent a name and provide a brief description of what it's supposed to do.

3) Then enter the "Instructions" that the Agent must follow to execute the work you want it to carry out. You can think
   of this field as an initial prompt for your agent.

4) In the "Knowledge" section, click "Upload files" to provide the information needed to specialize to your agent. The
   currently supported formats are URL, PDF and plain text.

5) When you are finished with the configuration, click "Save". The Agent will be available in the sidebar on the
   OpenAgents chat screen.
