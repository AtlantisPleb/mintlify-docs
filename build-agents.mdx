## How to build an agent

1) Visit [openagents.com/create](https://openagents.com/create).

2) Give the agent a name, description, and (optionally) an image.

3) Add instructions for the agent to follow. This is the initial prompt for the agent.

4) Optionally add a PDF the agent will use as knowledge to consult before responding. (Read more about our RAG algorithm [here](/rag).)

5) Click the save button and your agent is live. File uploads may take ~30 seconds to process. Your agent will say 'Ready' when the knowledge has finished processing.

## Payouts

While the Agent Store is in beta, payouts will be made once daily, with amounts proportional to usage.

Payment rates will vary. Generally top agents should earn at least a few dollars worth of bitcoin per day.

To withdraw bitcoin, you must attach a [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) to your account in Settings. [See tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1781703101327757410)

If you do not yet have a Lightning Address, the easiest way to obtain one is by signing up on [Stacker News](https://stacker.news/).

In a few weeks we will soon introduce 'pay as you go' pricing for some agents.

We are moving in a direction of fully programmatic payouts tied to paid usage. See our [Flow of Funds wiki page](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/wiki/Flow-of-Funds) for more on that.

If you need help with anything related to bitcoin or have any questions about payouts, create a post in our [Stacker News community](https://stacker.news/~openagents).
