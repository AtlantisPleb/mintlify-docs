## How to build an agent

1) Visit [openagents.com/create](https://openagents.com/create).

2) Give the agent a name, description, and (optionally) an image.

3) Add instructions for the agent to follow. This is the initial prompt for the agent.

4) Optionally add a PDF the agent will use as knowledge to consult before responding. (Read more about our RAG algorithm [here](/rag).)

5) Click the save button and your agent is live. File uploads may take ~30 seconds to process. Your agent will say 'Ready' when the knowledge has finished processing.
